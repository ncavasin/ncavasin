### Hi there 👋

My name is Nicolas Cavasin & i'm a backend software developer.


- :atom: I'm working as DevOps engineer in [CloudHesive LATAM](https://www.cloudhesivelatam.com/).
- - Previously, i worked in the backend of [Hub - Technical Sales](https://hub.inc/) using Java + Springboot.
- 🤓 I'm currently reading [High Performance Java Persistence](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Java-Persistence-Vlad-Mihalcea/dp/973022823X), which i would recommend to any Java developer that's interested in how Databases are managed by Hibernate.
- 🌱 In my free time i enjoy reading [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) & [Vlad Mihalcea](https://vladmihalcea.com/) articles. Nowadays, i'm diving into stuff i don't master -but i really care- such as CICD and some Postman testing.
- 💆‍♂️ During my leisure time i enjoy a lot hitting the gym, going out with my friends, hanging out with my girlfriend and drinking argentinian mate 🧉.
- 📫 If you want to get in touch you can finde me at ncavasin97@gmail.com
